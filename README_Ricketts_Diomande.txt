1) So first make sure you have all 7 Matlab apps open:
   CPSProject_App1, CPSProject_App1_2, CPSProject_App2, CPSProject_App3, CPSProject_App4, 
   CPSProject_App5, and CPSProject_App6. 

2) Once you have all of them open, go to CPSProject_App1 
and hit the green Matlab run arrow. Our opening screen should pop up. Hit the 
start button. Next, an app page with the title “What’s first” should appear. 
I would recommend choosing the bride, but the bridesmaid will also work if you hit it.  

 

If you picked bride a wedding dress screen should appear. You can pick whatever criteria 
you want in the drop down, it all should work, but I would recommend picking mermaid and 
glamorous.  Once you have selected your criteria hit the button. 
Three wedding dresses should appear. Hit the refresh button and select the dress in 
the top left corner (for color changing purposes). If you want to play around with 
the code a little bit before you hit, select you can hit the back to options button 
and it will take you back to the wedding dress screen, or you can hit the back to 
main button, which will take you back to the main screen. 

3) Once you have selected 
your dress a see dress in different color screen should appear. You can use the 
slider to change the color. The thing is it only works once, I haven’t implemented 
a loop yet, so you can only change the dress color once. I hope you like it took 
a whole week to figure out.  

4) So once again you have your go back or go to the main buttons.
 The only difference is that go back takes you back to the bride page with all of the dresses
 displayed, as opposed to the bride options page. I would recommend hitting the go back to main button
, so you can look at the bridesmaid's stuff. This one is really easy to operate. Just do 
exactly what you did for the bride's stuff. That s it!!!! Also open the CPS
project2 pdf for code information.
